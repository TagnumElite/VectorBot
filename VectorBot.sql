/*
WELCOME MY DEAR ONLOOKER
My SQL knowledge is horrible so therefor the commands inside this file
may look atrosious as well as my spelling. (I am lazy just to let you know)

For now what this is supposed to do is pre-create the tables for you, the reason I
don't pre-create the dev tables anymore is because I like to make sure they work,
that's why every time you run this script the dev tables get deleted

In the future I want to move to something like wordpresses meta system so that I don't
have to DROP, CREATE and ALTER tables anymore.
