General
---------

General questions!

MultiGuild Splash Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is will not be programmed in because of many things.

I will name some:

- High Storage
    - A user will have a banner per guild
- High CPU/Memory Usage
    - Each time a user is updated he will get a new splash

I have more, I won't and will not script MultiGuild Splash Support.
If you want me to do it as an example then I will.
Even then it will not be enabled even in dev mode!

Database
--------

Questions regarding database logging will answerd here!

I have no questions right now.

Parser Util
-----------

Questions regarding cogs.utils.parser.Parser

Why does some of the Guild[Members/Roles/GuildChannels] have blank perms or confs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is to do with config and permission handleing for each guild separately.
