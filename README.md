### Image Extension?
This will be used for a few things like when adding a new team on a website (WORDPRESS API SUPPORT) and it has an avatar. We will take that avatar and find the most used color and make them a role on discord with that color. Like I said, experimental and will not be enabled by default means.

## FAQ : The Short Version
### Where is the main FAQ?
In the [Wiki](https://github.com/TagnumElite/VectorBot/wiki)!
### This bot looks familiar?
Thats because to understand discord.py I forked @Rapptz RoboDanny and built off on that.
### I want to report a bug:heavy_exclamation_mark:
Make an issue, same goes for suggestions!
### How did you learn to code? :coffee:
Self taught. Going around, looking at docs and taking apart existing code to see how everything works.
### I got an JSON Error with the configs.json!
Please remove all 'comments' EG `//This is a comment` from the configs.json. These comments are for guidelines and break the JSONDecoder
### Why start on version 6?
Because this is an continuation of my other bots
